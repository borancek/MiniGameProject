# MiniGameProject
This project was completed during my undergraduate degree (October 2021) and is one of my early attempts at coding.
It may not adhere to the highest coding standards, but it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.
I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement on this project, as well as on my coding journey in general. Feel free to share your insights with me as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.
