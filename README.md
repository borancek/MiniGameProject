# MiniGameProject
This project was completed during my undergraduate degree (October 2021) and is one of my early attempts at coding.
It may not adhere to the highest coding standards, but it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.
I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement on this project, as well as on my coding journey in general. Feel free to share your insights with me as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

I took on this project with the primary objective of expanding my proficiency in Java programming. I explored various aspects of coding consisting of user input handling, manipulation of arrays and ArrayLists, and the implementation of for loops and while loops. This project consists of a collection of three miniature games, each crafted to serve as a hands-on exploration of the Java language, offering valuable insights into syntax and the underlying mechanics of Java programming.
